        A football team is a group of players selected to play together in the various team sports known as football. Such team
        selected to play in a match against an opposing team, to represent a football club, group, state or nation, an all-state
        selected as a hypothetical team (such as a Dream Team or Team of the Century) and never play an actual match.
        There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of 
        Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during
         The expansion of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the
          controlled Empire. [8] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football 
          deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage. [9] In 1888 
          League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 20th century,
           various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.

        the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).
        often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court
        scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the opposing side's half of the court.
        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck
        if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.
        The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used
        In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks
        speed compared to the balls in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nate
